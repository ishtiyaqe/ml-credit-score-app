## :dart: About ##

ML Credit Score is a machine learning-based web application that predicts a user's credit score based on input features. The project includes a Django backend that loads a pre-trained XGBoost model (.pkl) and a modern React + Tailwind CSS frontend that visualizes the score using a car-meter-style UI with smooth animations.

<h2>ðŸ§  Model Training</h2>

<p>The credit score prediction model was built using a <strong>stacked ensemble learning approach</strong> to improve accuracy and robustness:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We trained <strong>three separate XGBoost binary classifiers</strong> on the training dataset, each with a different decision threshold (0.15, 0.3, and 0.9). These thresholds control the sensitivity of the base models, creating diverse prediction behaviors.</li>
  <li>For each base model, predictions on the training and test sets were converted to binary labels using their respective thresholds. These binary predictions served as <strong>meta features</strong>.</li>
  <li>The meta features from all base models were stacked into a new feature matrix.</li>
  <li>A <strong>logistic regression meta-model</strong> was then trained on this stacked feature matrix to optimally combine the base modelsâ€™ outputs.</li>
  <li>This stacked model architecture leverages the complementary strengths of individual base classifiers, achieving better overall performance than any single model.</li>
  <li>All three base XGBoost models and the final logistic regression meta-model were saved separately for production use.</li>
  <li>During inference, raw input features are first passed through the base models to generate meta features, which are then input to the meta-model for the final prediction.</li>
</ul>

<p>This stacking approach balances precision and recall by combining diverse base model thresholds with a simple, interpretable meta-model, making it well-suited for credit scoring tasks.</p>
